# Feature Specification: merchant-location-product-api

**Feature Branch**: `001-merchant-onboarding`
**Created**: 2026-04-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "Expose merchant location and product create/update API on the MCP server so other LLM/AI agents can create and update merchant locations and products. MCP ingestion may create placeholder branches/products, but newly created records must remain inactive until reviewed."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Create Merchant Location (Priority: P1)
An automated agent or admin needs to register a physical or operational location for an existing MerchantBranch so customers and downstream systems can reference it.

Independent Test: Call the MCP API to create a location with branchId; verify the location is persisted and returned with id, createdAt, and updatedAt.

Acceptance Scenarios:
1. Given an existing branch, when the agent calls POST /v1/branches/{branchId}/locations with valid payload, then a 201 is returned and location is associated to the branch.
2. Given an unknown branch, when the same call is made, then a 404 is returned.

---

### User Story 2 - Create Product for a Location (Priority: P1)
An automated agent needs to create a product tied to a specific MerchantLocation so payments and listings can reference location-scoped products.

Independent Test: Call POST /v1/branches/{branchId}/locations/{locationId}/products; verify 201 and product fields persisted.

Acceptance Scenarios:
1. Given an existing location, when creating a product with required fields (name, priceMinor, currency), then a 201 and product id are returned.
2. Given an unknown location, a 404 is returned.

---

### User Story 3 - Update Location and Product (Priority: P2)
Agents must be able to update mutable fields (address, geolocation, product price/availability) without changing branch ownership.

Independent Test: PATCH endpoints update fields and return 200 with updated resource and updatedAt changed.

Acceptance Scenarios:
1. Valid updates return 200 and reflect new values.
2. Concurrent updates are handled idempotently (last-writer-wins by updatedAt) and return appropriate status.

---

### User Story 4 - Ingest Catalog Images from Agent Sources (Priority: P2)
Agents must be able to create or update product records from menu photos by supplying a local image path or base64 image bytes, optionally with crop coordinates that isolate the product image before upload.

Independent Test: Call the MCP product tool with a valid JPEG/PNG file path and crop rectangle; verify the product image is uploaded to object storage, the product stores an object key, and the product remains inactive if newly created.

Acceptance Scenarios:
1. Given a server-readable image file path, when the agent creates or updates a product through MCP, then the image is uploaded through the standard private object-storage path.
2. Given valid crop coordinates, when the agent submits the image through MCP, then only the cropped image is stored.
3. Given a missing file path, invalid base64, unsupported content type, oversized image, or invalid crop rectangle, then the MCP call fails without leaving a partial product update.

## Edge Cases

- Creation requests for locations/products with duplicate external IDs should be idempotent.
- Partial updates with invalid data must return 400 without mutating persisted resource.
- Product creation when the branch exists but location is inactive should return 409 or configurable policy.
- MCP-created branches/products must not become buyer-visible before review; they are created with `active = false`.
- MCP lookup/update must find inactive records so repeated ingestion updates the same draft record instead of creating duplicates.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: MCP MUST expose create and update APIs for MerchantLocation tied to an existing MerchantBranch.
- FR-002: MCP MUST expose create and update APIs for Product scoped to a merchant branch/location context.
- FR-003: API MUST validate that branchId exists and belongs to the requesting tenant when a branch id is supplied. Authentication MUST be via tenant-scoped JWT including a branch ownership claim (e.g., branch_id or tenant_id). Requests lacking proper tenant/branch claim MUST be rejected with 403.
- FR-004: API MUST return standard HTTP status codes: 201 on create, 200 on update, 400 on validation errors, 404 for missing parent resources, 409 for business conflicts, 412 for precondition failures (optimistic locking). Updates SHOULD accept an If-Match (ETag) header or a version field and return 412 Precondition Failed when the client's expected version does not match the current resource.
- FR-005: Persistent fields: id, branchId, locationId (for product), createdAt, updatedAt, active flag.
- FR-006: API MUST support idempotent create. Support both an Idempotency-Key header (server-side deduplication by header) and an optional client-supplied UUID in the request body. The server should treat requests with the same Idempotency-Key or client-supplied id as the same operation and return the original resource on retries. Return 409 only for business conflicts that are not idempotent retries.
- FR-007: Auditing: user/agent identity and request metadata recorded for create/update actions.
- FR-008: Updates MUST support partial updates via PATCH for MerchantLocation and Product; PUT (full replace) optional.
- FR-009: MCP branch and product creation MUST default new records to `active = false`; lookup/update tools MUST search active and inactive records.
- FR-010: MCP product image ingestion MUST accept either `imageBase64` or `imageFilePath` plus content type, and MAY accept `cropX`, `cropY`, `cropWidth`, and `cropHeight` for server-side JPEG/PNG cropping before upload.
- FR-011: MCP image ingestion MUST use the same private object-storage, object-key persistence, MIME validation, size validation, and signed retrieval behavior as the REST product image API.
### Key Entities

- MerchantBranch (existing)
- MerchantLocation: id, branchId, name, address fields, geolocation (lat/long), googlePlaceId, active, createdAt, updatedAt
- Product: id, branchId, locationId if applicable, name, description, priceMinor/decimal price, currency or merchant-inherited currency, active, image object key, createdAt, updatedAt

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

- SC-001: Agents can create a MerchantLocation and Product and receive a persistent id within one request cycle (end-to-end success measured by 201 + read-back verification).
- SC-002: 95% of valid create/update requests complete within acceptable latency for agent workflows (user-facing "near-instant").
- SC-003: All created/updated resources include audit metadata (creator id, timestamp).
- SC-004: MCP-created branches/products are inactive by default and can be reviewed before becoming visible in buyer-facing views.

## Assumptions

- Agents normally supply a valid existing branchId; helper tools may create missing placeholder branches by name, but those branches remain inactive until reviewed.
- Authentication/authorization is provided by existing MCP infrastructure; endpoints will enforce tenant/branch ownership rules.
- Prices are represented as minor units (integer) and currency is ISO-4217 code.
- Backwards compatibility: existing merchant/branch data model remains unchanged.


## Clarifications

### Session 2026-04-21
- Q: Update semantics for MerchantLocation/Product APIs → A: PATCH (partial updates) (recommended: easier for agents and avoids sending full resource)
- Q: Domain canonical name for routes → A: Support both (C) - alias /v1/merchants and /v1/branches (route aliasing)
- Q: Idempotency strategy for create endpoints → A: Support both header and optional client id (D) - flexible, prefer Idempotency-Key when available
- Q: Authorization/tenant enforcement → A: Require tenant-scoped JWT with branch claim (A) - enforces tenant isolation and least privilege
- Q: Conflict resolution for concurrent updates → A: Optimistic locking (B) - use If-Match/ETag or version precondition, return 412 on mismatch

### Session 2026-04-23
- Q: Can MCP tools create branches/products during catalog ingestion? → A: Yes, helper tools can create missing records by name, but created records default to inactive.
- Q: How should MCP product image upload work? → A: Accept base64 bytes or a server-readable image file path, with optional crop coordinates, then upload through the same object-storage path as the REST product image API.
